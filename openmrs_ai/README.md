## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- OpenMRS instance (or use included mock data)
- OpenAI API key (optional)
- Ollama installation (optional, for local AI processing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jmesplana/openmrs_ai_insights.git
   cd openmrs_ai_insights
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. In a separate terminal, start the proxy server:
   ```bash
   npm run proxy
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Local Development Options

When running locally, the application offers two modes:

1. **Mock Data Mode** (default):
   - Uses built-in mock patient data instead of connecting to an OpenMRS server
   - No need to handle CORS issues during development
   - Just click "Connect" with any credentials to get started
   - Includes three sample patients for testing
   - Search for "Smith" or "Johnson" to find patients

2. **Local Proxy Mode**:
   - Toggle off the "Use mock data" switch in Settings to use this mode
   - Connects to the real OpenMRS API through a local proxy server
   - Requires running the proxy server in a separate terminal:
     ```bash
     npm run proxy
     ```
   - Requires valid OpenMRS credentials

## 💡 Use Cases

### Clinical Decision Support
- Quick review of patient history, conditions, vitals, and trends
- Natural language querying for specific medical information
- Highlight potential issues or concerning values

### Medical Education
- Interactive learning with realistic patient scenarios
- Explore medical relationships and causations
- Practice clinical reasoning in a safe environment

### Research and Analysis
- Extract insights from complex patient data
- Identify patterns that may not be immediately apparent
- Generate summaries of patient history for case studies

### Administrative Efficiency
- Quickly gather information for reporting purposes
- Summarize relevant patient information for referrals
- Reduce time spent manually reviewing charts

## 🔧 Configuration

### Using OpenAI

1. Open the settings panel in the application
2. Select "OpenAI" as the AI provider
3. Enter your OpenAI API key
4. Save settings

### Using Ollama (Local AI)

1. [Install Ollama](https://ollama.ai/download) on your local machine
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3` (or other model of your choice)
3. Start Ollama locally
4. In the application settings, select "Ollama (Local)" as the AI provider
5. Set the endpoint (default: `http://localhost:11434`)
6. Select your preferred model
7. Save settings

### Using Mock AI

- No configuration needed - this is the default when no API keys are provided
- Great for UI testing and development
- Can answer basic questions about the patient data

## 📈 Key Problem Solved

OpenMRS AI Insights addresses several critical challenges in healthcare information systems:

1. **Information Overload**: Healthcare providers often struggle to quickly find relevant information in patient records. This tool allows natural language queries to extract only the needed information.

2. **Limited Accessibility**: Traditional EMR interfaces can be complex and difficult to navigate. A conversational interface makes patient data more accessible to all users.

3. **Privacy Concerns**: By offering Ollama integration for local AI processing, the tool provides advanced AI capabilities without sending sensitive patient data to external services.

4. **Integration Challenges**: The application's proxy server simplifies integration with existing OpenMRS installations, addressing common CORS and authentication issues.

5. **Resource Constraints**: In resource-limited settings, the ability to run locally and use mock data allows for training and demonstration without requiring constant internet connectivity or API usage costs.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- API keys are stored locally in the browser and never transmitted to third parties
- Ollama integration allows for completely local AI processing with no data sent to external services
- All API requests go through a local proxy to prevent exposing credentials
- No patient data is stored outside your local environment

## Usage

1. **Connect to OpenMRS**:
   - Enter your OpenMRS server URL, username, and password
   - Default values are provided for the demo server:
     - URL: https://o2.openmrs.org/openmrs
     - Username: admin
     - Password: Admin123
   - For local development, you can use mock data with any credentials

2. **Search for Patients**:
   - Enter a search term (at least 3 characters)
   - Select a patient from the results
   - For mock data mode, try searching for "Smith" or "Johnson"

3. **View Patient Data**:
   - Browse through the tabs to view different aspects of the patient's data
   - Expand/collapse sections to see more details

4. **Ask AI Questions**:
   - Configure your preferred AI provider in Settings
   - Type questions about the patient in the input field
   - View AI-generated responses based on the patient data

## Deployment to Vercel

This application is designed to be easily deployed to Vercel, with serverless functions to handle API proxying:

1. **Push your repository to GitHub**
2. **Connect your repository to Vercel**:
   - Create a new project in Vercel
   - Select your repository
   - Keep the default settings (Vercel will automatically detect it's a Vite/React app)
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **How it works on Vercel**:
   - The application's frontend is served as static files
   - Serverless API routes (`/api/proxy.js` and `/api/stream.js`) handle all the proxying
   - No need to run a separate proxy server in production

## How CORS Issues Are Handled

This application handles CORS issues in several ways:

1. **For local development**: 
   - Default: Mock data mode that doesn't require API connections
   - Alternative: Local proxy server that forwards requests to OpenMRS API

2. **For Vercel deployment**:
   - Serverless API routes handle all proxying seamlessly
   - All API requests are routed through these serverless functions
   - The vercel.json configuration contains the necessary rewrites to make this work

3. **For other production environments**:
   - Direct API connections (when deployed on domains allowed by the OpenMRS server)
   - Create serverless functions to proxy the requests
   - Configure the OpenMRS server to allow CORS from your domain

## Troubleshooting CORS Issues

If you encounter CORS errors like this:
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://o2.openmrs.org/openmrs/ws/rest/v1/session' from origin '...' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

### For Vercel Deployment:
1. Verify your vercel.json has the correct configuration:
   ```json
   "rewrites": [
     { "source": "/api/:path*", "destination": "/api/proxy" },
     { "source": "/api/stream/:path*", "destination": "/api/stream" }
   ]
   ```

2. Make sure your openMrsService.js is configured to use the proxy for production:
   - Check that it's using the proxy URL format for API requests
   - Ensure auth credentials are properly passed through

3. Deploy the latest changes to Vercel:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix CORS configuration"
   git push
   ```

### For Local Development:
1. Make sure the proxy server is running:
   ```bash
   npm run proxy
   ```

2. Verify the proxy server is running on port 3001 (check your terminal)

3. For faster testing, you can use the mock data mode by enabling it in Settings
